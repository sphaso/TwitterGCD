# TwitterGCD
Twitter Bot in Elixir that calculates the GCD of a set of given numbers.

It's not deployed yet, so it only works in those rare occasions when I have it run on my PC.

*Usage*        
Mention @GcdResolver with a set of space-separated list of numbers.
       
E.g.:           
@GcdResolver 25 30 35           
  =            
@yourName 5
